DESCRIPTION
    This module parses Ledger journal into Perl document object. See
    http://ledger-cli.org/ for more on Ledger, the command-line double-entry
    accounting system software.

    This module uses Log::Any logging framework.

    This module uses Moo object system.

ATTRIBUTES
METHODS
  new()
    Create a new parser instance.

  $ledgerp->parse($str | $arrayref | $coderef | $filehandle) => $journal
    Parse ledger journal (which can be contained in a $str, an array of
    lines $arrayref, a subroutine which will be called for chunks until it
    returns undef, or a filehandle).

    Will die if there are parsing errors in journal.

    Returns Ledger::Journal object. The object will contain a series of
    Ledger::Transaction objects, which themselves will be comprised of a
    series of Ledger::Posting objects.

  $orgp->parse_file($filename) => $journal
    Just like parse(), but will load document from file instead.

FAQ
  Why? Ledger is already a command-line program. It even has 'lisp' output.
    I am not trying to reimplement/port Ledger to Perl. This module doesn't
    do reporting or parse expressions or many other Ledger features. I use
    this module mainly to insert/delete/edit transactions to journal file,
    e.g. for programatically reconciling journal with internet banking
    statement, or for shortcuts (see App::LedgerUtils for example).
